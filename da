üíº Project Title: Customer Feedback Tagging and Complaint Classification for Banking Services
üìñ Scenario / Business Case:
Banks receive vast amounts of unstructured feedback through customer surveys, support tickets, app reviews, complaint filings, and social media. Quickly classifying this feedback into actionable categories can help:

Detect product or service issues early (e.g., "ATM malfunction", "Mobile App Bug", "Loan Processing Delay")

Ensure compliance with regulatory reporting (e.g., identifying complaints under categories like "Discrimination", "High Fees", "Privacy Breach")

Prioritize resolution based on severity

‚öôÔ∏è Solution Design:
üóÇ Data Sources:
Customer service chat logs

Mobile app and website reviews

Complaint submissions (e.g., CFPB complaint database)

Social media mentions (optional)

üìê Processing Pipeline:
Text Preprocessing:

Clean text (remove PII, standardize formats)

Optional: Language detection and translation for multilingual feedback

Feature Extraction with Pretrained Embeddings:

Use Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to transform each piece of feedback into a semantic vector

Store embeddings for efficient reuse

Supervised Classifier (No Heavy Training):

Train a Logistic Regression or XGBoost classifier on labeled feedback data

Example Categories:

Product Issues: Mobile App, Credit Card, Loan, Online Banking

Service Quality: Customer Support, Responsiveness, Agent Behavior

Regulatory Risks: Privacy Concerns, Discrimination, Excessive Fees

Evaluation Metrics:

Use Precision, Recall, F1-Score for classification quality

Optionally apply ROC-AUC if it‚Äôs a binary classification scenario (e.g., regulatory risk vs. not)

Deployment:

API endpoint using FastAPI or Flask to classify new feedback in real-time

Optional: Build a Streamlit dashboard to visualize the volume and trends of different complaint categories over time

üìà Deliverables:
Python API that accepts feedback text and returns predicted tags

Visualization Dashboard (Monthly trend of complaints, Top 5 complaint categories, Severity heatmaps)

Classification Performance Report (Precision/Recall per class, Confusion Matrix)

üí° Example Use Cases:
Compliance Monitoring: Auto-flag potential regulatory risks in feedback for legal review

Product Management: Identify recurring issues with loan products or app features

Customer Service Optimization: Prioritize tickets related to high-impact categories like "Fraudulent Transactions"
