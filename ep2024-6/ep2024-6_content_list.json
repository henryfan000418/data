Part of this increase in prices can be traced to factors affecting firms' pricing decisions, which presumably depend on where firms think inflation is heading. See, for example, figure 2, which shows the interquartile range of responses from the Survey of Firms' Inflation Expectations (SoFIE)—the Cleveland Fed's survey of CEOs about their outlooks on inflation. The specific question that SoFIE asks is as follows: \"What annual inflation rate do you think the U.S. Federal Reserve is trying to achieve on average?\" These inflation expectations supposedly inform firms' price setting of their goods (and services). Figure 2 shows that before the Covid- 19 pandemic, the median response to this question was  $2\\%$  and the distribution was skewed to the right. As illustrated by figure 1, inflation surged in 2021- 22. Simultaneously, as illustrated by figure 2, the median of the medium- term inflation expectations rose by 50- 100 basis points from pre- pandemic levels and the distribution of the SoFIE responses skewed further to the right (that is, toward the upside). From this perspective, it would seem that inflation expectations became temporarily",

In the model, some firms will not be able to set their prices optimally at each point in time (because of menu costs or information frictions). When firms cannot reset the price of their good optimally, they index their previously set price in part based on the past observed inflation rate and in part based on their view of where inflation is heading. Hence, we shock their perceptions about future inflation while leaving unchanged the Federal Reserve's inflation target of  $2\\%$  in our model. This is a scenario where firms' expectations become unanchored, at least temporarily, but the Fed continues to follow its policy rule—which prescribes responding to inflation more than one for one whenever inflation is above or below the  $2\\%$  target—and the firms know this. This article is organized as follows. In the next section, we present our staggered- price New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents, describing its environment at a general level. Following that section, we discuss the calibration of the model and then go over the results of a simulation where an unexpected shock temporarily raises the inflation target  $(\\pi^{\\bar{x}})$  in the firms' price indexation rule. Next, we discuss the main economic mechanism that propagates the effects of the price indexation shock in our model economy. To close, we summarize the results from our model with heterogeneous agents relative to those from a counterpart model with a representative agent.",

        "text": "figure 5 shows the optimal choices for labor and savings for different productivity and wealth levels. The continuous blue line in each of the panels corresponds to the optimal choices on impact after the price indexation shock, whereas the dashed red line corresponds to the same decision rules in the absence of the shock (that is, in the stationary equilibrium). We find that highly productive agents, especially those with low to moderate levels of wealth (shown in the first two pairs of panels of figure 5), tend to work and save more relative to those with lower productivity. In aggregate, as shown in figure 6, the average amount of assets increases during the transition to the stationary equilibrium. This amplification mechanism is quantitatively significant as long as agents can invest in firms' shares. Endogenous equity ownership incentivizes agents to invest in physical capital as they can take advantage of future higher dividends, which are not redistributed uniformly across agents in the HANK model, but according to their stock ownership. This is also confirmed by the second- to- last panel in the bottom set of panels of figure A1 in the appendix, which reports the percentage change of the equity value  $q$  of the firms. The equity value  $q$  clearly increases persistently well above the stationary equilibrium in the HANK model, while it does not do this in the RANK model. Finally, in an alternative exercise (not shown), where we assume that the shares of the firms are evenly distributed, this mechanism is significantly dampened, rendering this response in the HANK model closer to that in the RANK model.8",

We studied the dynamics transmission of such a shock in a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, and nominal rigidities, and we compared it with the dynamics transmission from the same shock in a counterpart model with a representative agent. First, we find that this shock has sizable real effects in both cases. Second, we show that in the HANK model, agents exploit the initial higher wage by working more and saving more in order to engage in precautionary savings. This mechanism boosts physical capital accumulation and equity market values, thereby creating a substantial amplification of the shock's effects.

Kostek II, senior vice president and director of research in the Research Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, for sharing information about the percentile of the distribution of SoFiE responses.2 When the distribution of data is right- skewed, this means the data are not distributed symmetrically around the mean and the long tail of the distribution is to the right of the mean.3 Menu costs are the costs that firms incur when they change the prices of their goods (or services). Information frictions come from economic agents infrequently updating their sets of information.4 Price rigidity is the resistance of a market price to change fast, even when shifting economic conditions suggest a different price would be optimal.5 In equilibrium, since there is no aggregate risk, firms' equity and bonds are perfect substitutes.6 The elasticity of demand  $(\\in)$  and seller's desired markup  $(\\mu)$  are determined by the Lerner condition, which implies that  $\\mu = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon - 1}$ .7 Chang, Kim, and Schoffriede (2013) estimated these persistence and volatility values using the entire sample of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)—with all participants in the study being 18–65 years old. We discretize this process using the Rouwenhorst method, as in Kopecky and Suen (2010), with an 11- valued Markov chain.8 Although we do not show the results of this alternative exercise in this article, those results are available on request.9 There is no aggregate risk in both the HANK and RANK models.10 Note that the government bond supply is held constant to the stationary equilibrium value during the transition to the stationary equilibrium; hence, all savings are invested in physical capital and equity value.",

We search for the implied aggregate quantities that match the guesses using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm. For the unexpected shocks, we fix a long enough time horizon and guess paths for interest rates and the firms' total costs. Given the guesses, we compute the corresponding policy functions period by period in the backward phase and adjust the guesses in the forward phase by clearing all markets. We repeat this until adjustments to both guessed paths are numerically small.",
