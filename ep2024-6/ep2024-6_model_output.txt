<|box_start|>084 282 914 494<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>After two decades of extremely stable inflation, prices have grown markedly in the past few years, as shown in figure 1. Part of this increase in prices can be traced to factors affecting firms' pricing decisions, which presumably depend on where firms think inflation is heading. See, for example, figure 2, which shows the interquartile range of responses from the Survey of Firms' Inflation Expectations (SoFIE)—the Cleveland Fed's survey of CEOs about their outlooks on inflation. The specific question that SoFIE asks is as follows: "What annual inflation rate do you think the U.S. Federal Reserve is trying to achieve on average?" These inflation expectations supposedly inform firms' price setting of their goods (and services). Figure 2 shows that before the Covid- 19 pandemic, the median response to this question was \(2\%\) and the distribution was skewed to the right. As illustrated by figure 1, inflation surged in 2021- 22. Simultaneously, as illustrated by figure 2, the median of the medium- term inflation expectations rose by 50- 100 basis points from pre- pandemic levels and the distribution of the SoFIE responses skewed further to the right (that is, toward the upside). From this perspective, it would seem that inflation expectations became temporarily<|md_end|>

To what extent can these changes impact inflation and output? On the one hand, higher price setting tends to increase the equity value of the firms, which benefits shareholders. On the other hand, higher price setting tends to increase the nominal wage, which benefits workers. Hence, the rise in inflation and inflation expectations can have uneven consequences for different households, which, in turn, can affect the level of inequality in the economy. Does this differential impact matter for inflation and output?<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>085 183 914 448<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>We use a staggered- price New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents to answer these questions. In the model, some firms will not be able to set their prices optimally at each point in time (because of menu costs or information frictions). When firms cannot reset the price of their good optimally, they index their previously set price in part based on the past observed inflation rate and in part based on their view of where inflation is heading. Hence, we shock their perceptions about future inflation while leaving unchanged the Federal Reserve's inflation target of \(2\%\) in our model. This is a scenario where firms' expectations become unanchored, at least temporarily, but the Fed continues to follow its policy rule—which prescribes responding to inflation more than one for one whenever inflation is above or below the \(2\%\) target—and the firms know this. This article is organized as follows. In the next section, we present our staggered- price New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents, describing its environment at a general level. Following that section, we discuss the calibration of the model and then go over the results of a simulation where an unexpected shock temporarily raises the inflation target \((\pi^{\bar{x}})\) in the firms' price indexation rule. Next, we discuss the main economic mechanism that propagates the effects of the price indexation shock in our model economy. To close, we summarize the results from our model with heterogeneous agents relative to those from a counterpart model with a representative agent.<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 460 145 478<|box_end|><|ref_start|>title<|ref_end|><|md_start|># Model<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 493 915 617<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>We build on a broad class of medium- scale dynamic general equilibrium models, typically used in central banks. These models seek to describe the entire economy as the interactions between various sectors and markets (for example, households, firms, and government) in a state of equilibrium where supply equals demand subject to nominal price rigidities (or price stickiness). In particular, we consider a heterogeneous agents New Keynesian (HANK) model with uninsurable idiosyncratic risk to household productivity, borrowing constraints, and nominal rigidities à la Calvo (1983) with staggered price setting. In this section, we describe the environment at a general level (see the appendix for details about the equilibrium conditions).<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>089 630 247 648<|box_end|><|ref_start|>title<|ref_end|><|md_start|># The environment<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>085 662 912 874<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>The economy is populated by a unit continuum of ex ante identical households with standard preferences over consumption and leisure. Households are endowed with stochastic idiosyncratic productivity that affects their labor income. Each household's productivity \((z_{t})\) is exogenous and follows \(\log z_{t} = \rho_{z}\log z_{t - 1} + \xi_{z,t},\) with \(\xi_{z,t}\sim N(0,\sigma_z^2)\), where \(\rho_{z}\) is the persistence of the process and where \(\xi_{z,t}\) is a random variable that follows a normal distribution (indicated by \(N\)) with variance \(\sigma_z^2\). Households decide how much to work, consume, and save. The household assets comprise government bonds, physical capital, and firms' equity. There is a borrowing constraint that prevents these households from taking asset positions lower than a certain negative level \((\phi_{a})\). While their optimal decisions are ex ante identical, the differences in household productivity induce different labor income and asset accumulations and, therefore, different consumption and saving decisions. These differences among households, in turn, generate wealth and income inequality. Hence, the model collapses to the representative agent New Keynesian (RANK) model if the uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks \((z)\) are removed.<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 888 913 923<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>The market structure of this model economy combines elements that are familiar from the standard New Keynesian literature (Smets and Wouters, 2007) with elements that are familiar from the standard incomplete<|md_end|>

While the final good is produced by a representative competitive firm, the intermediate goods are produced by monopolistically competitive firms. These firms are controlled by a risk- neutral manager who discounts future profits at rate \(\beta\), as in McKay, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2016). Profits are paid out to the households, with each household receiving a share of \(D_{t}\) proportional to its asset holdings. Unlike in McKay, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2016), households can trade firms' equity as well as the capital stock used in production. Finally, households trade a risk- free real bond with real interest rate \(R_{t}\) between periods \(t\) and \(t + 1\). There is a stock of government debt outstanding with the real face value \(B_{t}\). The government raises tax revenue to finance interest payments on this debt. These taxes are collected by levying a flat tax on households' income from labor and dividends.<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>085 253 908 342<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>The intermediate goods firms face frictions in adjusting their prices that imply that they can only update their prices with probability \(\theta\) per period, as in Calvo (1983). When they are not allowed to update, they adjust their price according to an indexation rule that combines the past value of inflation \((\pi_{t - 1})\) with the central bank's inflation target \((\pi^{*})\), as in Smets and Wouters (2007); in particular, after \(s\) periods without the chance of reoptimizing the price, a firm sets its price \((p_{s}^{*})\) according to the following rule:<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>461 354 540 377<|box_end|><|ref_start|>equation<|ref_end|><|md_start|>\[
p_{s}^{*} = X_{s}p^{*},
\]<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>085 387 888 423<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>where \(p^{*}\) is the price when the firm had the last chance to choose it optimally and \(X_{s}\) is the indexation rule, with<|md_end|>

X_{s} = \Pi_{l = 1}^{s}\big(1 + \pi_{l - 1}\big)^{l - p}\big(1 + \pi^{*}\big)^{1 - \iota_{p}}.
\]<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>084 471 908 650<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>For example, in the period immediately after the last optimal price choice, that is, \(s = 1\), the new price is adjusted as \(\left(1 + \pi\right)^{s}\left(1 + \pi^{*}\right)^{1 - p}\). The parameter \(\iota_{p}\) measures the degree at which prices are adjusted based on the past levels of inflation. When \(\iota_{p} = 0\), for example, the price will be adjusted using only the central bank's inflation target. (In the indexation rule, \(\Pi\) indicates the product operator with iterator \(l\).) Indexation captures the fact that firms set prices only partially to reflect their view on future inflation. We assume that in the short run, firms increase indexed prices faster, thereby reflecting their view that higher inflation is expected, which is what we observe in the Cleveland Fed survey results (figure 2). Simultaneously, we assume that the same firms stick to their belief that the Fed follows a Taylor rule with an inflation target of \(2\%\). Thus, indexing to a moving inflation target generates higher inflation. We interpret this scenario as a mild form of unanchoring.<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 662 888 699<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>In the model, these firms produce intermediate goods, which are sold to the final good producer. The final good producer's cost minimization problem yields<|md_end|>

<|box_start|>084 778 903 896<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>where the demand for the firm- specific good \((y)\) depends on its price \((p^{*})\), the overall price \((P)\), aggregate output \((Y)\), and the relative price demand elasticity \(\left(\epsilon = - \frac{\mu}{1 - \mu}\right)\). The lower the demand elasticity, the larger the desired markup \((\mu > 1)\) that the firm can charge to buyers. Hence, when intermediate goods producers can update their price, they set it by taking into account a production constraint and the demand constraint of the final good producer.<|md_end|>
--------------------------------------------------
<|box_start|>083 061 915 295<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>Because firms know that they might not be able to optimize the price of their good in the future, their decision entails choosing a price optimal also for a number of future periods where they most likely will not be allowed to reoptimize; thus, their problem is inherently dynamic. The solution to the firms' problem is a markup rule where a firm charges a fixed markup \(\mu\) over a weighted- average of future discounted marginal costs \(\gamma_{s}\) (as captured by equation A17 in the appendix). The weight for each future marginal cost has two elements to it: the term \(\beta (1 - \theta)\), which puts less weight on future marginal costs because of discounting (\(\beta\) is the discount factor) and because the price being set now has lower probabilities of still being around in \(s\) periods of time as \(s\) gets bigger (\(\theta\) is price stickiness), and the term \(\left(\frac{P X_{s}}{P_{s}}\right)^{\frac{\mu}{1 - \mu}} Y_{s}\), which represents aggregate factors affecting firm demand in the future. In this article, we are interested in what happens when the firms' indexation rule, \(X_{s}\), unexpectedly increases (via an increase in the inflation target, \(\pi^{*}\), in the firms' price- setting function).<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>085 307 902 343<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>Finally, the central bank controls the nominal risk- free interest rate by following a simplified Taylor rule, whereby the interest rate \((i_{t})\) reacts more than one for one with inflation.

<|box_start|>083 462 914 737<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>Our model period is one quarter, and our calibration is summarized in figure 3. We calibrate the persistence and the standard deviation of the idiosyncratic productivity shocks so that \(\rho_{z} = 0.939\) and \(\sigma_{z} = 0.287\), respectively. We fix the steady- state real interest rate at \(2\%\) annually and adjust the discount factor to match this. We assume that household preferences are separable in consumption \((c)\) and labor \((n)\), that is, \(u(c_{t}) - \nu (n_{t}) = \frac{c_{t}^{1 - \sigma_{c}}}{1 - \sigma_{c}} - \frac{n_{t}^{1 + \sigma_{n}}}{1 + \sigma_{n}}\), where \(u\) is the utility of consumption, \(\nu\) is the disutility of labor, \(1 / \sigma_{c}\) is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (or equivalently, the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk), and \(1 / \sigma_{n}\) is the Frisch elasticity of labor supply. We set the coefficient of relative risk aversion to 1 and the Frisch elasticity of labor supply to 1. Both values are within the range of values typically considered in the literature. For our choices of the desired markup of intermediate firms, \(\mu\), and probability of maintaining a fixed price, \(\theta\), we follow Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) and set \(\mu = 1.2\) and \(\theta = 0.15\). The degree of indexation to past inflation is 0.2, close to the estimated mode value obtained by Smets and Wouters (2007). Capital share and depreciation are set to standard values in the literature, that is, 0.4 and 0.02, respectively. We assume that households can borrow up to a limit \(\phi_{a}\), which we fix at \(- 1.5\). This parameter is calibrated so that the borrowing limit corresponds to one quarter of average labor income.<|md_end|>

<|box_start|>085 574 913 769<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>We assume that at time zero, the economy is at its stationary equilibrium and an unexpected shock temporarily raises the inflation target \((\pi^{*})\) in the firms' price indexation rule. In particular, we calibrate the shock so that, on impact, the inflation target drifts positively by 50 basis points annually and then reverts back to zero with relatively high persistence (0.9). For the sake of comparison, we feed identical shocks to both the HANK model and its RANK counterpart. Typically, firms and the central bank have the same inflation target in their policy functions. However, we assume that firms perceive a temporary inflation target increase, while the central bank sticks to a \(2\%\) target. Hence, the unexpected one- time change in the price indexation rule only affects firms' pricing decisions and it does not change the central bank's inflation target in the monetary policy rule. We view this as a tractable way to capture information frictions that can arise in the short term. Explicitly modeling these frictions is outside the scope of this article. Figures 4, 5, and 6 report the dynamic transmission of these shocks to the economy.<|md_end|>

The continuous blue line in each of the panels corresponds to the optimal choices on impact after the price indexation shock, whereas the dashed red line corresponds to the same decision rules in the absence of the shock (that is, in the stationary equilibrium). We find that highly productive agents, especially those with low to moderate levels of wealth (shown in the first two pairs of panels of figure 5), tend to work and save more relative to those with lower productivity. In aggregate, as shown in figure 6, the average amount of assets increases during the transition to the stationary equilibrium. This amplification mechanism is quantitatively significant as long as agents can invest in firms' shares. Endogenous equity ownership incentivizes agents to invest in physical capital as they can take advantage of future higher dividends, which are not redistributed uniformly across agents in the HANK model, but according to their stock ownership. This is also confirmed by the second- to- last panel in the bottom set of panels <|txt_contd|><|md_end|>

The equity value \(q\) clearly increases persistently well above the stationary equilibrium in the HANK model, while it does not do this in the RANK model. Finally, in an alternative exercise (not shown), where we assume that the shares of the firms are evenly distributed, this mechanism is significantly dampened, rendering this response in the HANK model closer to that in the RANK model.8<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 589 912 625<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>Another amplification mechanism in the HANK model comes from the presence of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, leading agents to engage in precautionary savings to shield against future negative productivity shocks.9<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 638 913 726<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>For these reasons, as illustrated by figure 4, aggregate labor \((N)\) increases by more in the HANK model than in the RANK model. In the HANK model, agents exploit their initial boost in labor income to repay debt and/or invest in physical capital. The top right panel of figure 4 shows that in the HANK model, physical capital \((K)\) in aggregate increases persistently and remains well above the counterpart in the RANK model.10<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 740 907 846<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>In order to clear the asset market, characterized by higher savings and investment levels, the interest rate \((R)\) goes up by more in the HANK model, as illustrated by the top left panel of figure 4. This increase in the interest rate is consistent with higher inflation levels via the Taylor rule. Furthermore, the high levels of savings and investment that push the interest rate up are chiefly due to the assumption of endogenous ownership of firms' shares. In its absence, the responses of both inflation and the interest rate are closer to their responses in the RANK model.<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>086 860 894 914<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>Finally, because of this strong saving and investment motive, the amplification mechanism in the HANK model transforms the supply nature of the shock observed in the RANK model into a demand- type transmission.<|md_end|>

<|box_start|>085 094 906 271<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>In this article, we study the propagation mechanisms of a shock that affects the firms' pricing decisions; in particular, we look at the dynamics transmission of an increase in the inflation target in the firms' price indexation rule. We studied the dynamics transmission of such a shock in a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, and nominal rigidities, and we compared it with the dynamics transmission from the same shock in a counterpart model with a representative agent. First, we find that this shock has sizable real effects in both cases. Second, we show that in the HANK model, agents exploit the initial higher wage by working more and saving more in order to engage in precautionary savings. This mechanism boosts physical capital accumulation and equity market values, thereby creating a substantial amplification of the shock's effects. Third, this mechanism transforms the supply nature of the shock observed in the RANK model into a demand- type transmission.<|md_end|>
<|box_start|>085 284 903 391<|box_end|><|ref_start|>text<|ref_end|><|md_start|>To summarize, we study how a shock to the firms' price indexation rule influences aggregate outcomes through the inequality among agents in an economy, represented by a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents. We compare the aggregate dynamics in this model with those in a representative agent model. We find that such shocks have significant real effects in both models, but in the HANK model, agents respond by increasing labor and savings, leading to higher capital accumulation and equity values.<|md_end|>

Kostek II, senior vice president and director of research in the Research Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, for sharing information about the percentile of the distribution of SoFiE responses.2 When the distribution of data is right- skewed, this means the data are not distributed symmetrically around the mean and the long tail of the distribution is to the right of the mean.3 Menu costs are the costs that firms incur when they change the prices of their goods (or services). Information frictions come from economic agents infrequently updating their sets of information.4 Price rigidity is the resistance of a market price to change fast, even when shifting economic conditions suggest a different price would be optimal.5 In equilibrium, since there is no aggregate risk, firms' equity and bonds are perfect substitutes.6 The elasticity of demand \((\in)\) and seller's desired markup \((\mu)\) are determined by the Lerner condition, which implies that \(\mu = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon - 1}\).7 Chang, Kim, and Schoffriede (2013) estimated these persistence and volatility values using the entire sample of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)—with all participants in the study being 18–65 years old. We discretize this process using the Rouwenhorst method, as in Kopecky and Suen (2010), with an 11- valued Markov chain.8 Although we do not show the results of this alternative exercise in this article, those results are available on request.9 There is no aggregate risk in both the HANK and RANK models.10 Note that the government bond supply is held constant to the stationary equilibrium value during the transition to the stationary equilibrium; hence, all savings are invested in physical capital and equity value.<|md_end|>

For the stationary equilibrium, we guess the interest and aggregate labor and then solve for the household policy functions, calculate the corresponding transition matrix and population ergodic distribution, and then compute the implied aggregate quantities. We search for the implied aggregate quantities that match the guesses using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm. For the unexpected shocks, we fix a long enough time horizon and guess paths for interest rates and the firms' total costs. Given the guesses, we compute the corresponding policy functions period by period in the backward phase and adjust the guesses in the forward phase by clearing all markets.
